# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project builds a predictive model to determine passenger survival on the Titanic using supervised machine learning techniques. It encompasses end-to-end steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment of the trained model.

## Project Highlights

- Performed *data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier removal*
- Applied *feature encoding and scaling*
- Explored survival relationships using *Seaborn visualizations*
- Trained and evaluated:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Performed *hyperparameter tuning* using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Saved and reused trained model using *Joblib*
- Analyzed *feature importance* to interpret model decisions

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC Curve
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Best Model
Random Forest achieved the best performance and was saved for deployment.
